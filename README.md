🌱 Environmental Awareness & Sustainable Practices Analysis
This project explores environmental awareness and sustainability practices among individuals through a survey-based data collection and analysis using Power BI. The objective is to understand how aware people are about their environmental impact and whether they actively engage in reducing it through sustainable practices.
📋 Project Overview
We conducted a survey using a Google Form to collect responses from a diverse audience. The survey focused on:
•	Awareness of environmental issues and sustainable practices
•	Active implementation of sustainable behaviors
•	Demographic details for segmentation and analysis

A total of 132 responses were collected and categorized into three main sections:
1.	Demographics
2.	Sustainability Knowledge & Awareness
3.	Sustainable Practices Engagement

📊 Dataset Structure
1. Demographics Table
This includes respondent background information:
•	Response_ID 
•	Age_Group
•	Gender
•	Educational_Background
•	Employment_Status
•	Income_Level
These fields help segment and analyze responses across different population groups.
2. Sustainability Knowledge / Awareness Table
This section captures the awareness level of respondents:
•	Concern_Level 
•	Information_Seeking_Frequency
•	Familiarity_with_Sustainable_Practices
These insights reflect how informed individuals are about sustainability issues.


3. Sustainable Practices Engagement Table
This highlights actual environmental behavior:
•	Active_Engagement_in_Sustainable_Practices
•	Usage_of_Reusable_Products
•	Waste_Segregation_Practice
•	Willingness_to_Pay_More_for_Organic_Goods
These indicators show how knowledge translates into real-world actions.

🔗 Data Modelling in Power BI
Using Power BI, relationships were established between the tables via the Response_ID key:

•	Demographics ↔ Sustainability Knowledge
•	Sustainability Knowledge ↔ Sustainable Practices
These connections allow for cross-sectional analysis, such as:
•	How different income levels impact sustainable behavior
•	Whether a higher level of awareness leads to better practices

📈 Key Insights
•	Visualization and filtering capabilities in Power BI helped reveal important trends
•	For instance, users with higher concern and awareness levels were more likely to use reusable products and segregate waste.
•	Insights can be used to design targeted awareness campaigns and sustainability education for specific groups.
