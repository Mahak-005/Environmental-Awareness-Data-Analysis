ðŸŒ± Environmental Awareness & Sustainable Practices Analysis
This project explores environmental awareness and sustainability practices among individuals through a survey-based data collection and analysis using Power BI. The objective is to understand how aware people are about their environmental impact and whether they actively engage in reducing it through sustainable practices.
ðŸ“‹ Project Overview
We conducted a survey using a Google Form to collect responses from a diverse audience. The survey focused on:

Awareness of environmental issues and sustainable practices

Active implementation of sustainable behaviors

Demographic details for segmentation and analysis

A total of 132 responses were collected and categorized into three main sections:

Demographics

Sustainability Knowledge & Awareness

Sustainable Practices Engagement

ðŸ“Š Dataset Structure
1. Demographics Table
This includes respondent background information:

Response_ID

Age_Group

Gender

Educational_Background

Employment_Status

Income_Level

These fields help segment and analyze responses across different population groups.

2. Sustainability Knowledge / Awareness Table
This section captures the awareness level of respondents:

Concern_Level

Information_Seeking_Frequency

Familiarity_with_Sustainable_Practices

These insights reflect how informed individuals are about sustainability issues.

3. Sustainable Practices Engagement Table
This highlights actual environmental behavior:

Active_Engagement_in_Sustainable_Practices

Usage_of_Reusable_Products

Waste_Segregation_Practice

Willingness_to_Pay_More_for_Organic_Goods

These indicators show how knowledge translates into real-world actions.

ðŸ”— Data Modelling in Power BI
Using Power BI, relationships were established between the tables via the Response_ID key:

Demographics â†” Sustainability Knowledge

Sustainability Knowledge â†” Sustainable Practices

These connections allow for cross-sectional analysis, such as:

How different income levels impact sustainable behavior

Whether a higher level of awareness leads to better practices

ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights
Visualization and filtering capabilities in Power BI helped reveal important trends.

For instance, users with higher concern and awareness levels were more likely to use reusable products and segregate waste.

Insights can be used to design targeted awareness campaigns and sustainability education for specific groups.
